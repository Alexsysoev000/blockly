This is a free and open source visual programming language based on blockly from Google & MIT, Arduino codes are created by just combining the blocks, then they are compiled (check) and finally [upload to any Otto robot] (https://wikifactory.com/+OttoDIY/projects)  or similar Arduino(C++) or Micro:bit or Python robots.

This software already works offline on Windows operating systems. You can [download the latest release from our website directly](https://www.ottodiy.com/#blockly-and-app)it is ready to go, no need to intall libraries or additional setup or even Arduino IDE, it is all integrated, ready to use.Only if your computer do not recognize the USB device or Otto, you have to install the CH341 driver that is also here in the pilotes folder.

MAC and Linux version are under development, as some requested and as much as we want them to be ready too, unfortunatelly, there are not many testers, neither commited volunteers even for very simpple BETA Tests, so WE NEED YOU!, if you really need this software for your OS.

Help us, please don't ask when would be avaliable, since it only will be ready, if you collaborate with us.

## Online APP

Otto Blockly is also a web tool. You can [give it a try here.](https://ottodiy.github.io/blockly/) BUT the USB device cannot be recognized by the browser, therefore you won't be able to compile or upload the code.., althouught you can just simple copy and paste the generated code into your [local Arduino IDE] (https://www.arduino.cc/en/Main/Software), therefore you can use this tool from any operative system.
